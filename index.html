            Haryana became a state of India on November 1, 1966, so 1st November is also known as Haryana day. The
            present-day Haryana is the region where, along with the banks of the River Saraswati, the Vedic Civilization
            began and matured. It was here that the Vedas were written, as the Aryans chanted their sacred Mantras.
            Replete with myths and legends, Haryana’s 5000-year-old history is steeped in glory. It was here that Lord
            Krishna preached Bhagavad-Gita at the start of the battle of Mahabharat.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was on this soil that saint Ved Vyas wrote Mahabharat in Sanskrit. Before the Mahabharat war, a battle of
            ten kings took place in the Kurukshetra region in the Saraswati valley. But it was the Mahabharat War,
            approximately in 900 BC, which gave the region worldwide fame. Mahabharat knows Haryana as Bahudhhanyaka,
            the land of plentiful grains, and Bahudhana, the land of immense riches. The word Hariana occurs in a 1328
            AD Sanskrit inscription kept in the Delhi Museum, which refers to the Haryana region as heaven on earth.

        <h2> Haryana Language</h2>
        <p>
            With Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, and English forming the main languages, there are numerous dialects that are
            spoken in Haryana. However, almost all of them have their base in Hindi. Sanskrit is also taught in most of
            the schools in Haryana. In towns and cities, English is still to be adopted as the household lingo but is
            spoken in a hazy mixture of Hindi.
            <br>
            The most striking feature of Haryana is its language itself; or rather, the manner in which it is spoken.
            Popularly known as Haryanvi, Bangaru, or Jatu, it is perhaps a bit crude but full of earthy humor and
            straightforwardness. With rapid urbanization, and due to Haryana’s close proximity to Delhi, the cultural
            aspects are now taking a more modern hue

            <b> Men's Costumes</b>
        </header>
        <p>
            The men generally wear ‘Dhoti’, the wrap-around cloth, tucked in between the legs with a white-colored kurta
            worn atop it. ‘Pagri’ is the traditional headgear for men, which is now worn mainly by the old villagers.
            All-white attire is a status symbol for men.

            <b>Women's Costumes</b>
        </header>
        <p>
            Women love to wear colorful dresses. Their basic trousseau includes ‘Damaan’, ‘Kurti’ & ‘Chunder’. ‘Chunder’
            is the long, colored piece of cloth, decorated with shiny laces, meant to cover the head and is drawn in the
            front like the ‘pallav’ of the saree. Kurti is a shirt like a blouse, usually white in color. The ‘Daaman’
            is the flairy ankle-long skirt, in striking colors.

        <h3> <b>Haryana Cuisines</b></h3>
        <p>
            Haryanvi cuisine is like the people of Haryana – simple, earthy, and inextricably linked to the land. In
            Haryana, the emphasis is on food that is wholesome, fresh, and prepared with little or no fuss at all.

            Their staple food is wheat or bajra so it is ‘Land of Rotis, vegetables and plenty of milk and ghee. Fresh
            vegetables are taken daily. Pethe ki subji is made on special occasions. The most relished dishes are Raabri
            and Bajre ki khichri with lassi. Teet ka achar is a pickle made of Kair tree.
